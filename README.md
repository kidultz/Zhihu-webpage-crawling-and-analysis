# Zhihu-webpage-crawling-and-analysis

I used R's rvest package to extract 140 hottest answers and the sex of each respondent . Then I applied the LDA model of the answer corpus of each gender respectively and find some interesting conbinations .

Before web crawling , I'm used to **saving the webpage on the desktop firstly** cause it brings much more convenience to the further work !

Note that there is **no space between Chinese words** as in English when using Chinese word segmentation , but Java has solved this problem. We only need to **load rJava and rwordseg** in R-console.

This is the first time for me to try text analysis , and I'm open to all suggestion , thank you !
